# Problem 2: Even Fibonacci Numbers

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

$$1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...$$

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

# Solution

My approach is the same across all three languages. Starting after the first two values in the sequence, keep track of the running sum and the most recent two values. Calculate the next term in the series by adding the previous two. While the new term is less than 4 million, check if it's even. If it is, add it to the running total. Update the last two terms and calculate the next term, then run through the loop again.
