# Problem 2: Even Fibonacci Numbers

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

$$1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...$$

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

# Solution

My approach is the same across all three languages. Starting after the first two values in the sequence, keep track of the running sum and the most recent two values. In a loop, get the next value by adding the most recent two together. If the new value is above 4 million, break out of the loop. Otherwise, if the new term is divisible by two, add it to the running total. Update the most recent two terms and continue on with the loop.
